-- 4. Using a list comprehension, define an expression fibs :: [Integer]
-- that generates the infinitesequence of Fibonacci numbers
fibs :: [Integer]
fibs = 0 : 1 : [f0 + f1 | (f0, f1) <- zip fibs (tail fibs)]

-- 5. Define appropriate versions of the library functions for the 
-- following type of binary trees:
data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
              deriving Show
              
repeatTree :: a -> Tree a
repeatTree x = Node t x t
               where t = repeatTree x

takeTree :: Int -> Tree a -> Tree a
takeTree 0 _            = Leaf 
takeTree n Leaf         = Leaf
takeTree n (Node l x r) = Node (takeTree (n-1) l) x (takeTree (n-1) r)
 
replicateTree :: Int -> a -> Tree a 
replicateTree n = takeTree n . repeatTree

-- replicateTree 2 3
-- Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 3 (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)

-- 6. Newtonâ€™s method for computing the square root of a (non-negative)
-- floating-point number n can be expressed as follows:
--   + start with an initial approx to the result;
--   + given the current approx a, the next approx is defined by the 
--     function next   a = (a+n/a)/2;
--   + repeat the 2nd step until the two most recent approxs are within some 
--     desired distance of one another, return point - most recent value.
